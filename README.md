[```Genetic Algorithm```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/tree/master/Genetic%20Algorithm) is a Windows 10 virtual enviroment made in PyCharm. So this means that you will have to select/use a different interpeter if you are on Mac OSX or a Linux/UNIX based OS.
# Path Finding
Run [```path_finding.py```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/master/Genetic%20Algorithm/path_finding.py)
