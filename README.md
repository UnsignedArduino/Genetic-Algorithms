# Genetic-Algorithms
A bunch of genetic algorithms written in Python 3.
[```Genetic Algorithms```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/tree/master/Genetic%20Algorithms) is a virtual enviroment made in PyCharm on Windows 10. So this means that you will have to select/use a different interpeter if you are on Mac OSX or a Linux/UNIX based OS.
# Path Finding GUI
Run [```path_finding_gui.py```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/master/Genetic%20Algorithms/path_finding_gui.py). Please make sure [```path_finding.py```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/master/Genetic%20Algorithms/path_finding.py) is in the same directory.
## Settings for Path Finding GUI

Edit the settings in the window above.
# Path Finding CLI
Run [```path_finding.py```](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Genetic-Algorithms/blob/master/Genetic%20Algorithms/path_finding.py)

Sample command: ```python path_finding.py 400 300 16 50 100 100 250 0.1 1 1```
## Settings for Path Finding CLI
Arguments are ```WIDTH```, ```HEIGHT```, ```PRITE SIZE```, ```FPS```, ```GENERATIONS```, ```POPULATION```, ```DNA LENGTH```, ```MUTATION RATE```, ```NAME TO BROADCAST```(Unused currently), and whether to display stats in console (```1``` = True, ```0``` = False)
